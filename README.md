# SpiceM - Basic  Food Website

SpiceM is one of my earliest and most basic projects, created using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This simple local food website aims to introduce users to local culinary delights, featuring a showcase of local cuisine, business listings, an interactive map, and contact information for nearby restaurants, cafes, and eateries.

## Getting Started

To run SpiceM locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spicem.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spicem
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Explore the various sections of the website to discover local food options.
2. Click on individual businesses to view more details.
3. Utilize the interactive map to locate each food establishment.
4. Find contact information for inquiries or reservations.

## Customize

Feel free to customize the website for your local area:

- Modify the content in the `index.html` file to showcase local businesses and their specialties.
- Update the styling in the `styles.css` file to match your preferred aesthetic.
- Add or remove sections based on the information you want to display.
